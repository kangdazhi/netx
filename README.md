# Azure RTOS NetX

A high-performance implementation of TCP/IP protocol standards, Azure RTOS NetX is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all supported processors. It has a unique piconet architecture. Combined with a zero-copy API, it makes it a perfect fit for todayâ€™s deeply embedded applications that require network connectivity.

## Documentation

Documentation for this library can be found here: http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/rtos/netx

# Understanding inter-component dependencies

The main components of Azure RTOS are each provided in their own repository, but there are dependencies between them--shown in the following graph--that are important to understand when setting up your builds.

![dependency graph](docs/deps.png)

# Building and using the library

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools:

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.0 or later
* [GCC compilers for arm-none-eabi](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

## Cloning the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/azure-rtos/netx.git
```

## Building as a static library

Each component of Azure RTOS comes with a composible CMake-based build system that supports many different MCUs and host systems. Integrating any of these components into your device app code is as simple as adding a git submodule and then including it in your build using the CMake command `add_subdirectory()`.

While the typical usage pattern is to include threadx into your device code source tree to be built & linked with your code, you can compile this project as a standalone static library to confirm your build is set up correctly.

```bash
$ cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/cortex_m4.cmake -GNinja .

$ cmake --build ./build
```

NOTE: You will have to take the dependency graph above into account when building anything other than threadx itself.

# Repository Structure and Usage

## Branches & Releases

The master branch has the most recent code with all new features and bug fixes. It does not represent the latest General Availability (GA) release of the library.

> When you see xx-xx-xxxx, 6.x or x.x in function header, this means the file is not officially released yet. They will be updated in the next release. See example below.

# Security

Azure RTOS provides OEMs with components to secure communication and to create code and data isolation using underlying MCU/MPU hardware protection mechanisms. It is ultimately the responsibility of the device builder to ensure the device fully meets the evolving security requirements associated with its specific use case.
